# Comp 1004 - Computing practice
Welcome to the Retro Golf Game project repository! This project is part of the Computing Practice module and is aimed at creating a single-page web application.
# Project Overview
For this project, I have developed a retro-inspired golf game tailored for golf enthusiasts and retro game players, primarily targeting individuals aged 18-24. Drawing inspiration from classic games like Raft Wars and 8 Ball Pool, Retro Golf combines nostalgic elements with modern web development techniques to deliver an engaging and enjoyable gaming experience.
# Project Contents 
This repository contains the code for the web-application as well as the project portfolio. The portfolio includes all of the documentation for the project, such as the project plan, UML diagrams, the architecture, a poster and the issues and constraints encountered. 

 I have also used the Kanban board which has helped me keep track of all the tasks for the project.
