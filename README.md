# Comp 1004 - Computing practice

For the Computing practice module, this project is aimed at creating a single page web application. For my project, i have decided to create a retro golf game that is aimed at golf players and retro game players, ages 18-24. My inspirtation for this game has come from games like raft wars and 8 ball pool. This github repo contains the coe for the website and the portfolio for this project, which comprises of the project plan, UML diagrams, a poster and the issues and constraints.
